## Project Brief

This project was my 3rd project while on my internship with BIZGEES. The brief:

* Create a short 30 second - 2 minute game.

* Aimed at ages 18 - 25.

* To highlight celebrity and famous refugees.

* Be fun and engaging.

* Use AI to aid the creation.

Bob Marley, 
Freddie Mercury, 
Rita Ora, 
Gloria Estefan, 
Jerry Springer, 
Mika, 
Wyclef Jean, 
Albert Eienstein, 

## Technologies used

For the project the aim was to use AI, mainly Rosebud AI (https://play.rosebud.ai/home)

On the platform a developer can clone games created by other developers and change them for their own purpose. 

I chose to use a game called The Baby Monkey Saga, Evolved from: 2D Playground,
Created by: radio_biscuit

Rosebud can generate AI images an I created most of mine in Rosebud then added text over the top in photoshop.
